# Clustering-Analysis
This work is an overview on unsupervised learning - *Clustering Analysis*. I started working on this for a small assignment in a data mining class. The idea was to apply a learned technique on a dataset, but I ended up describing everything from the basis. My focus was to explain how clustering works under very easy terms and the help of visualizations. 

There are 2 documnets included: clustering.pdf and walmart.pdf. Clustering.pdf will describe the process behind KMeans and go over the Elbow and silhouette plots. Walmart.pdf is just an application of KMeans over a Kaggle competition dataset. I will also create a folder for the data sets used and the jupyter notebooks.

Note: I won't be covering more advanced topics like fuzzy clustering and hierarchical clustering.
